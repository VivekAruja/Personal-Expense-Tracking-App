# Personal-Expense-Tracking-App
This Python app allows users to track and categorize their monthly expenses, helping them stay within a budget. Users can enter expense details directly into the terminal, and the app will save these entries to a file. It also reads the file to provide a summary of total expenses for the month and shows how much more the user can spend to stay within their set budget.

ðŸŽ¯ App Requirements

1. Expense Entry: Allow users to input expense details, including name, category, and amount.

2. Data Storage: Save expense entries in a .csv file.

3. Expense Summary: Read the file to summarize total expenses for the current month.

4. Budget Tracking: Inform users how much they can still spend for the rest of the month to stay within their budget.

âœ¨ Bonus Features
1. Categorized Expenses: Display expenses categorized by their type.

2. Daily Budget Estimate: Provide a rough estimate of how much can be spent per day to stay on budget.

ðŸ’¡ Project Structure
The final project will include two files:

1. expense.py: Defines the Expense class for creating and storing expense data.

2. expense_tracker.py: Contains the main application logic.
   
âœ… Tasks
1. Develop the Expense Class: Create a class in expense.py to represent and manage expense data.

2. Implement Main Application Logic: Write the core logic in expense_tracker.py to handle user input, save data, and provide summaries.

3. Test the Application: Run the app and ensure all functionalities work as expected.
